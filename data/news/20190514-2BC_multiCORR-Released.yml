  <h3>MAAT Makes 360° of Phase Easy</h3>
  <p class="lead">Company announces release of comprehensive new multi-band correlation meter and monitor controller</p>
  <p>MAAT Incorporated, a manufacturer of exceptional performance professional audio solutions, today announced the release of 2BC multiCORR, a cross platform plug-in for detailed monitoring of phase relationships for digital audio. The new product continues MAAT’s emphasis on value, also incorporating essential monitor controls into one product.</p>
  <p>Available for both Windows and macOS, 2BC multiCORR builds on the solid foundation of MAAT’s 2BusControl, a free metering and monitor controller plug-in. 2BC multiCORR is a multi-view metering package, both plug–in and native app, that provides visual and aural insight into a mix. The carefully chosen center frequencies and trueLinear™ scale enable its thirty one bands of left/right correlation metering to provide a highly informative view that complements listening impressions. In addition, five monitoring modes allow an engineer’s most important asset, their hearing ability, to assist in critical decision making. Left/Right Balance and a single band correlation meter round out the measurement offerings.</p>

  <h3>MAAT Gets Rad With FiDef</h3>
  <p class="lead">Company announces the addition of FiDef® to benchmark minimum phase EQ</p>
  <p>MAAT Incorporated, a manufacturer of exceptional performance professional audio solutions, today announced the release of thEQblue version 3.0, a cross–platform plug–in for correction and aesthetic equalization of digital audio. The new version includes a world’s first, the addition of the exclusive FiDef® digital audio process.</p>
  <p>Available for select workstation platforms, thEQblue v3 builds on the proven foundation of MAAT’s celebrated original, while bringing a new layer of subtle refinement to the already reference quality minimum phase equalizer. FiDef is a proprietary psychoacoustic process, developed in cooperation with neuroscientists and DSP experts, that activates a receptive listener subconscious. It makes digital audio content more compelling and brings audiences closer to the emotion of the music.</p>

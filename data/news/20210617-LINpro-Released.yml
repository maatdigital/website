  <p>Building on the foundations of MAAT’s original LINearise plug–in, LINpro incorporates an all–new engine based on the current understanding of psychoacoustic, information theory and audio production best practices. MAAT’s CTO, Christoph Musialik, guided the development to ensure absolute fidelity.</p>

  <h3>MAAT Inaugurates Versatile Phase Shifter</h3>
  <p class="lead">MAAT announces the release of a new, analog–style phase shifter plus–in</p>
  <p>MAAT Incorporated today announced the release of RSPhaseShifter, a digital implementation of Roger Schult/German Audio Lab’s renowned Phase Shifter 500 Series W2324 hardware. The cross–platform plug–in creates a high quality, phase shifted version of a monaural or stereo input.</p>
  <p>RSPhaseShifter incorporates double precision internal processing, and algorithms optimized for highest fidelity. Providing a fast, convenient means of aligning individual mix elements for best subjective results, RSPhaseShifter also offers a delta mode, extending the application to the control of frequency–dependent stereo spread for MS workflows.</p>

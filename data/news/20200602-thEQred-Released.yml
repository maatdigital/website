  <h3>MAAT Completes Trilogy with New LP EQ</h3>
  <p class="lead">Company announces release of exclusive signature linear phase digital EQ plug–in</p>
  <p>MAAT Incorporated, a manufacturer of exceptional performance professional audio solutions, today announced the release of thEQred, a cross platform plug–in for equalization and enhancement of digital audio. The new product bookends the release of MAAT’s first member of their thEQ family, thEQorange.</p>
  <p>Available for both Windows and macOS, the new thEQred transforms Algorithmix’s much heralded Linear Phase PEQ Red’s reference quality into a contemporary, cross–platform product. thEQred digital audio equalizer fulfills the promise of extraordinary smoothness through frequency–based equalization with VariSlope™ technology, proprietary to thEQred. With VariSlope, shelving and cut filters offer continuous adjustment of slope from near zero to 24 dB/octave. The combination of linear phase and VariSlope affords very smooth, controlled spectral changes without any phase shift or group delay.</p>

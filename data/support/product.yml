title: Genuine DR &#43; OS & DAW Compatibility
items:
  - topic: Is my old machine compatible with your stuff?'
    reply: "• Our products support macOS 10.8 through 12, and Windows 7 through 11."

  - topic: "I’m running Merging’s Pyramix system with the MassCore option. Are MAAT’s products compatible?"
    reply: "• Yes, our products are compatible with Merging’s Pyramix MassCore/IntervalZero low level real time engine."

  - topic: "I’m running the 32 bit version of Sequoia/Samplitude, and my MAAT plug–in windows don’t float. What’s up?"
    reply: "• You may have noticed that <em>none</em> of your 32 bit plug–ins work correctly. This issue only occurs when using the 32 bit versions of a plug–in, and is caused by the “bit-bridge” that Sequoia/Samplitude uses to load plug–ins that have an incompatible bit depth. Fortunately, we ship both 32 and 64 bit versions of our plug–ins, so disable or remove the 32 bit version. Run only the 64 bit version of all your plug–ins and they will behave correctly."

  - topic: "I’m using your equalizer in Logic. The keyboard does not create sounds!"
    reply: "• The keyboard behavior in Logic is not a bug, it's a known Logic quirk…When one first starts up Logic and either inserts a MAAT equalizer or opens up a saved file, Logic does not run any audio through the plug–ins right away. As a result, plug–ins cannot output audio either. Once the user hits “Play” the first time, audio streams are then enabled and they can use the EQ’s keyboard normally."

  - topic: "What is DR Dynamic Range?"
    reply: "• DR Dynamic Range, what we at MAAT refer to as DR<em>i</em> or integrated DR, was introduced by Friedemann and initially promoted by the PMF, the Pleasurize Music Foundation. Friedemann Tischmeyer was the founder, and Karlheinz Brandenburg, Ronald Prent and Oliver Masciarotte are board members. At the time, there was no unit of measure for subjective dynamic range reduction. Friedemann found that there was no standardized method for gauging “dynamic density,” or the amount of aggressive dynamic range reduction being applied to popular music. So, together with some colleagues, he created the DR standard. MAAT is granted exclusive license to continue DR tool development.</br><strong>Note</strong> that DR is not simply the difference between the peak and quietest value of a track or the common but less than useful PLR or crest factor measurement. It’s more complex, which is how it’s able to provide a meaningful integer value that both represents how much a song is “crushed” and relates directly to how it actually sounds. After two decades, DR<em>i</em> has become a de factor international standard, with <a href='https://dr.loudness-war.info/' target='_blank'>many tens of thousands</a> of albums and songs measured for comparison by engineers and enthusiasts."

  - topic: "I bought a meter plugin that says it measures “Dynamic Range” and looks a lot like the original TT DR Dynamic Range meter. Trouble is, the dynamic range it shows is really different from what’s shown by MAAT’s meters. So, what’s the deal? Maybe two different measurement methods? I need to know what’s the actual DR of my client’s songs."
    reply: "• You guessed correctly; two different measurement methods. The only DR standard is the PMF’s DR<em>i</em> or integrated DR measurement standard. First seen in the TT DR Dynamic Range meter and TT DR Offline Meter, DR<em>i</em> is now used with permission in MAAT’s DR line including<br><a href='https://www.maat.digital/drmeter/' target='_blank'>DRMeter</a>, <br><a href='https://www.maat.digital/drm2/' target='_blank'>DRMeter MkII</a>, <br><a href='https://www.maat.digital/droffline/' target='_blank'>DROffline</a> and <br> <a href='https://www.maat.digital/dro2/' target='_blank'>DROffline MkII</a>. Other products which claim to measure DR are unauthorized, inaccurate and frankly bogus. Accept no substitutes!"

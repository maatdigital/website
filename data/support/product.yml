  - topic: 'Is my old Mac compatible with your dongle stuff?'
    reply: '• The current CodeMeter license framework supports macOS 10.10 through 10.13, which means 10.8 and 10.9 users have to manually install an older version of CodeMeter for macOS. Head over to <a href="https://www.wibu.com/us/downloads-user-software.html" target="_blank">Wibu</a> for all vintages of CodeMeter installers.'

  - topic: 'I’m running Merging’s Pyramix system with the MassCore option. Are MAAT’s products compatible?'
    reply: '• CodeMeter CmStick dongles on Merging’s Pyramix MassCore systems causes conflicts. CmStick dongles do not interoperate well with Merging’s MassCore/IntervalZero low level realtime engine. However, host–based CmActLicenses interoperate well and should be used when MAAT products are installed on MassCore–equipped systems.'

  - topic: 'I’m running the 32 bit version of Sequoia/Samplitude, and my MAAT plug–in windows don’t float. What’s up?'
    reply: '• You may have noticed that <em>none</em> of your 32 bit plug–ins work correctly. This issue only occurs when using the 32 bit versions of a plug–in, and is caused by the “bit-bridge” that Sequoia/Samplitude uses to load plug–ins that have an incompatible bit depth. Fortunately, we ship both 32 and 64 bit versions of our plug–ins, so disable or remove the 32 bit version. Run only the 64 bit version of all your plug–ins and they will behave correctly.'

  - topic: 'I've just bought a meter plugin that says it measures “Dynamic Range” and looks a lot like the original TT DR Dynamic Range meter and your DRMeter and DRMeter MkII. The dynamic range it shows is really different from what’s shown by MAAT’s meters. So, what’s the difference and why there is it? maybe two different measurement method? I need to know what is the right DR of my track!'
    reply: '• You guessed correctly; two different measurement methods! There is the PMF DR measurement standard, first seen in the TT DR Dynamic Range meter and TT DR Offline Meter and used with permission in MAAT’s DR line including DRMeter, DRMeter MkII, DROffline and DROffline MkII. Other products which claim to measure DR are unauthorized and inaccurate.'

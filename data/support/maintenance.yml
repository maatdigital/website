    reply: "• We recommend Etrecheck and DiskWarrior, two complementary utilities that are absolutely worth the investment. Both are great for periodic maintenance, and each one addresses issues that the other does not. Also, both repair critical issue that are invisible to Apple’s Disk Utility. A once-a-month pass with both products will keep your Mac running at peak efficiency with minimum hassle."

  - topic: "Can you recommend any products for routine Windows maintenance?"
    reply: "• We have found that, for Windows, applications advertised for optimization and repair do more harm than good. Instead, we recommend the factory tools like Disk Cleanup. For the Start button menu, choose All Programs→Accessories→System Tools→Disk Cleanup. If you are running Windows 10, then also use the built in defragmentation tools. From the Taskbar, select the search bar and enter “defrag”. Then, select <em>Defragment and Optimize Drives</em>.<br>

  - topic: "I upgraded from my old Mac to a new one. I used the Mac OS X Migration Utility to copy the documents, settings and apps from old to new, but this seems to have broken my license for my MAAT product in the process. I’ve tried using the CodeMeter app to fix this, but I'm getting an error. I also tried creating a new license request and still got an error message. How can I fix this?"
    reply: "First, make sure that you have the latest versions of your MAAT products. E–mail <support@maat.digital> for a link. Then, visit the MAAT <%= link_to 'License Portal', 'http://lc.codemeter.com/83343/depot/', target: '_blank' %>. In the Product Key field, type in or copy and paste your MAAT Product Key, including the dashes. In the resulting window, you should see your product(s) listed. Click <em>Restore Licenses</em>. Continue to follow the prompts for license restoration. This part of the process is very similar to regular online license activation."

  - topic: "Can you recommend any products for routine macOS maintenance?"
    reply: "We recommend Etrecheck and DiskWarrior, two complementary utilities. Both are great for periodic maintenance, and each one addresses issues that the other does not. Also, both repair critical issue that are invisible to Apple’s Disk Utility. A once-a-month pass with both products will keep your Mac running at peak efficiency with minimum hassle."

    reply: "• We recommend EtreCheck from Etresoft and DiskWarrior from Alsoft, two complementary utilities that are absolutely worth the investment. Both are great for periodic maintenance, and each one addresses issues that the other does not. Also, both repair critical issue that are invisible to Apple’s Disk Utility. A once-a-month pass with both products will keep your Mac running at peak efficiency with minimum hassle."

  - topic: "Can you recommend any products for routine Windows maintenance?"
    reply: "• We have found that, for Windows, most applications advertised for optimization and repair usually do more harm than good. One product we do recommend is Registry First Aid from Rose City Software. Also, we recommend the factory tools like Disk Cleanup. From the Start button menu, choose All Programs → Accessories → System Tools → Disk Cleanup.<br>
    If you are running Windows 10, then also use the built in defragmentation tools. From the Taskbar, select the search bar and enter “defrag”. Then, select <em>Defragment and Optimize Drives</em>.<br>
    For additional tips, search Microsoft’s support for “Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10”. When searching for 3rd party tips about tools and utilities, always use a trusted source like pcmag.com, pcworld.com or tomshardware.com."

  - topic: "Trying to install unsigned 3rd party products on your Mac?"
    reply: "• Due to increased security defaults in recent builds of macOS, you may need to try the following steps…<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Open “System Preferences” by clicking on the Apple icon and choosing that option.</li>
      <li>Select “Security & Privacy” from the “System Preferences” window.</li>
      <li>Select the “General” pane, then click the lock in the lower left corner.</li>
      <li>Enter your username and password to authenticate, then select “Unlock” to allow changes.</li>
      <li>In the “Allow apps downloaded from” section, select “Anywhere.”</li>
      <li>Close the window. You can now install unsigned applications that you trust. For security reasons, you may want to repeat this process checking “Mac App Store” as in step five above in order to make your Mac more secure.</li>
    </ol>"

  - topic: "I can’t find my license. Where is it?"
    reply: "• Your <strong>Product Key</strong> <em>is</em> your license. It was e–mailed to you when you purchased your product. If you cannot find your Product Key, contact customer service at the company from whom you purchased. For MAAT, that would be either 2Checkout.com or our current FastSpring.com.<br>
        &#8680; To make a “safety” copy or backup of your Product Key(s), open a new TextEdit or Notepad file. Then launch License Central from our Installers (linked above) and, using the lst in the Preferences’ Keys tab, copy your Product Keys. Paste into a plain text file and save it away on a USB flash drive with a meaningful file name like “2019_December MAAAT Product Keys.txt” or something similar. Don’t forget to label the flash drive! We also stongly suggest you print out a paper copy of your Product Keys in case the USB flash drive is lost or damaged."

  - topic: "What kind of search is going on with License Central? Is it sharing anything over the network or just confirming what's in your database and tools found on my drive according to Product Keys?"
    reply: "• It has a two–way “conversation” between your local host and the remote server; a Product Key inquiry followed by the server’s response. It knows where our plug–ins and apps are supposed to be stored, so it looks in those folders for items with our product names. It does not do recursive searches, digging into sub-folders as that doesn’t make sense for us to do. If you have organized your directories to better work for you, far be it for us to dig around in there. That’s why we provided two additional search paths.<br>
After it has checked your licenses, it also checks with the server on what are the current builds. It compares your installed versions so it knows if there are any updates available. That’s how it knows if your local copy is out of date."

  - topic: "What are the privileges License Central has, and also what kind of information does it share over the network through it's dedicated port?"
    reply: "• No special privileges as the directories it’s working in are not hidden or protected. Network communication is the same license info it uses when you open an app or instantiate a plug-in — it sends our “standard” query to the license server and first asks for a match with the Product Key(s) it found. The server replies with our standard response, which is what type of license and what is its duration."

  - topic: "When is MAAT discontinuing <strong><em>all</em></strong> Wibu licenses?"
    reply: "• We shut down all Wibu licensing on the 30th of June, 2020. Visit the <a href='https://www.maat.digital/support/#installers' target='_blank'>Installer section</a> of the Support page above, and make sure that you download the latest version of your product. Then, reinstall and reactivate with your existing Product Keys. We e–mailed your Product Keys to you when you purchased."

  - topic: "How many machines or activations is my license good for?"
    reply: "• So long as it’s not at the same time, you can jump between several workstations. Whenever the last MAAT instance is removed or closed on your computer, your license is returned automatically to the license server. So, another computer can open or instantiate your MAAT product and receive a new licensing lease without interruption.<br>
        Note that, if anything prevents the license from being returned such as WiFi dropping out, your license will “time out” and nonetheless become available again after an hour."

  - topic: "What kind of dongle does MAAT use? Can’t I use my iLok?"
    reply: "• We’ve tried Wibu, and we’ve tried PACE (iLok) but decided to create a modern, cloud–based license system for our products.
    <strong><em>Check this!</em></strong> You don’t need a dongle to use any of our software! MAAT licenses are now cloud–based."

  - topic: "I’m having trouble with my MAAT license. Can you help?"
    reply: "• We want to get you back to work as quickly as possible! To aid in troubleshooting any licensing issue, first please run License Central, which is liked above. We also include that utility during installation. Usually, simply opening and closing License Central, then restarting your plug–in host will fix most problems.<br>
    If you’ve run License Central and are still having problems, launch License Central again and <a href='mailto:support@maat.digital?Subject=License%20Issue%20Inquiry'>e–mail</a> the ZIP file that it creates to us, along with your Product Key (we e–mailed you your Product Keys when you purchased). We’ll take a look at the diagnostic ZIP and get back to you as soon as we can. The diagnostic ZIP file is written to your Desktop.
        <ul>
          <li>For macOS, in the Applications/MAAT folder launch; <code>/Shared/Utilities/DiagnosticsReporter.app</code></li>
          <li>For Windows C drive, in the \\Program Files\\MAAT folder, open <code>\\Shared\\Utilities\\DiagnosticsReporter.exe</code></li>
        </ul>"

  - topic: "I’m running Magix’s Sequoia or Samplitude DAW. Can I use MAAT’s dongle for both?"
    reply: "• For sure. Our CodeMeter CmStick <a href='https://www.maat.digital/dongle/' target='_blank'>dongles</a> can be used to store your Sequoia or Samplitude license. If you have a very old MAGIX dongle, you will need to work with MAGIX support to move your license.<br>
        In addition to MAGIX, several other vendors, including BaseHead, Propellerheads, 10bit FX, LightAct and Vengence Sound can use our CmSticks for license storage."

  - topic: "I already have a MAAT CodeMeter dongle. Can I use it with MAAT’s products?"
    reply: "• Not any more, but we’ll take back your MAAT dongle in exchange for a US$30 in–store coupon! Give us a shout at <a href='mailto:support@maat.digital?Subject=Dongle%20Exchange%20Inquiry'>Support</a> to learn more."

  - topic: "How many license activations do I have?"
    reply: "• Technically, you have three activations total, two replacements if you loose an activation. We assume that you backup your computer and can recover your Product Key(s), which are your proof of purchase. Without Product Keys, we cannot re–activate your license.<br>
        Now that MAAT licenses are cloud–based, you shouldn’t need anything more that your Product Key to recover your license even if your host computer dies a sudden death (We’re lookin’ at you, Windows fans). See the question “How can I move a MAAT license…” below for more information."

  - topic: "How can I move a MAAT license from one computer to another?"
    reply: "• The license itself resides in the Cloud. You can return or park your license on our licensing server, and pick it up later on another host. Once your product is licensed, click the Activate/Deactivate Online button to deactivate your license, then repeat to reactivate.<br>
        <em>Important!</em> If you save and close any DAW session that includes a MAAT instance, your license will be automatically returned to the Cloud. Pick it up on another Cloud–connected machine, right where you left off."

  - topic: "I need to work offline/remotely, or I’ll be traveling and need to get work done away from the Internet. What to do?"
    reply: "• If, for security reasons, you have an offline host computer or you plan on working without a reliable internet connection, you can request an offline license. This will license your MAAT product without periodically contacting our licensing server. If you anticipate working without the internet for more than an hour at a time, take a moment to surrender your online license, and replace it with an offline version.<br>
        To prepare for offline activation, you will need some method to move your License Confirmation file to the offline host machine. That can be accomplished in any number of ways, but a flash drive or “thumb drive” is often readily available and most convenient. You will also need your Product Key that was supplied to you via e–mail when you purchased your MAAT product. The offline activation process starts with generating a License Request, with a “maatr” file extension, which is submitted on–line to our server or via e–mail to <a href='mailto:support@maat.digital?Subject=Offline%20Activation%20Inquiry'>MAAT Support</a>. A License Confirmation file, with a “maatc” extension, will be returned to you, which will activate your product.<br>
        For offline activation, do the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Navigate to the back panel of your MAAT product by clicking on the gear icon or, for older products, the MAAT logo on the front panel.</li>
          <li>Click on the Activate/Deactivate Offline button, and follow the prompts.</li>
        </ul>
        You can also return or park your license back on our licensing server, and pick it up later on another host.
        <ul>
          <li>Once your product is licensed, click the Activate/Deactivate Offline button to deactivate your license, then repeat on another host to reactivate.</li>
        </ul>"

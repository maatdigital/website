  - topic: What does MAAT stand for?
    reply: MAAT stands for “Mastering Academy Audio Tools.” In addition, Maat or Ma’at is, according to Wikipedia, “…the ancient Egyptian concepts of truth, balance, order, harmony, law, morality, and justice. Maat was also the goddess who personified these concepts, and regulated the stars, seasons, and the actions of mortals and the deities who had brought order from chaos at the moment of creation.” For audio engineering, order from chaos is a good thing!

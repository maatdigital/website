    <p>Note that this Upgrade page only works for Product Keys that activate single products. Many of our Product Keys unlock multiple products, and cannot be upgraded using the method outlined on this page. If you would like to upgrade your original DR product to MkII and receive a “The promotional code you entered does not exist” error message, simply e–mail us a note that includes your original DR Product Key to: <%= mail_to 'support@maatinc.zohodesk.com' %> and we can help.</p>

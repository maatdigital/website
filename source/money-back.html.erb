      We offer all customers a 15 day, 100% money back guarantee from purchase
      date! You simply need to deactivate your license, which returns it to us.
      In the case of offline licenses, this can be confirmed by a receipt
      through the specific licensing utility from Wibuâ€“Systems installed on your
      host computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply send your customer number and order number to support@maat.digital,
      and include how you want to receive your refund. We will check the
      returned license and refund you after the license have been successfully
      deleted. Please allow us up to 5 business days to process your refund
      request. Though we accept Money Back requests without any stated reason,
      we would appreciate it if you let us know why you are returning your
      license. This helps us to further enhance the quality of our products.

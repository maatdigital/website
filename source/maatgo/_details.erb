        <h3>Introduction </h3>
        <p>
          Available for all major plug-in formats, including VST 2, VST 3 and AAX for macOS and Windows plus Audio Units for macOS, MAAT<em>go</em> delivers complete “preamp” channel routing, plus a software goniometer that authentically replicates an analog oscilloscope experience.

      MAAT<em>go</em> is built explicitly for everyone who listens to HRA (High Resolution Audio) files and streams on their computer. In the Golden Age of consumer hi–fi, some preamplifiers had not only a “balance” knob, but stereo/mono blend controls and even an oscilloscope to instantaneously display amplitude, frequency and the phase relationship between left and right channels. Marantz and Panasonic sometimes included an oscilloscope in their receivers, while the Apt Corporation’s legendary, groundbreaking Holman Preamplifier had a range of channel steering switches and a continuous stereo/mono blend control.

      MAAT<em>go</em> combines a variety of channel steering controls with a balance control and goniometer. The goniometer or “phase scope” feature quickly conveys global trends and troubles, with a visual out–of–phase warning built in. Plus, an optional autogain feature insures that you’ll see an understandable display with a very wide range of input amplitudes.

      Back in the Analog Era, most hi–fi enthusiasts had “separates,” individual stereo components, each serving one purpose. With the advent of “computer audio,” that rig can been reduced to a personal computer feeding a DAC or digital–to–analog converter. In turn, the DAC feeds a power amplifier. While this minimalist setup eliminates a preamplifier, it has only a volume control and most player applications lack any other controls other than volume. Enter MAATgo, a preamp’s worth of advanced controls. When any of the controls are disabled, they are completely “out of circuit,” and do not affect the sound quality. When any control is enabled, it’s DSP uses double precision floating point math, to ensure maximum fidelity. Also, MAAT<em>go</em> will operate at up to 384 kHz, compatible with the highest fidelity lossless PCM files and streams presently available.

      Visualization has long been part of enjoying music on a computer, and MAAT<em>go</em>’s options are easy to like. Unlike an oscilloscope which takes up room in your equipment rack, MAAT<em>go</em> has a notable absence of knobs. Control over gain, focus, “phosphor” color, drawing style and persistence are all there in the preferences, and everything can be saved as a personal preset.<br>
      Another nice feature with MAAT<em>go</em> is that a standalone or “native” version is included, native in that it runs natively without the help of a DAW or player app. The standalone version let’s you really saavy geeks out there use MAAT<em>go</em> as stream–through processor, just like a “separate” in the hi–fi hardware world.  
      </p>
      <p>
      All of MAAT<em>go</em>’s functionality is wrapped in an information-rich yet visually unobtrusive, resizable user interface that occupies only a small slice of screen real estate. Likewise, the plug-in is very &quot;light weight&quot; demanding an absolute minimum of CPU resources so it won´t slow down your player and host.

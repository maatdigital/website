        <h3>Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
          <h5>Michael, Romanowski, Coast Mastering</h5>
          <p><em>“MAAT’s thEQblue is a remarkable EQ plugin. The interface is unique among the multitude of EQ plugins available. Showing a different kind of representation of energy as it is distributed across the frequency spectrum. I like that the information is very customizable, depending on needs or particular projects. More impressive to me is the number and types of slope profiles available. I find them all very usable for different circumstances. I don’t have a “go to” slope, as each project is different, and requires listening before making any decision.<br>
          What I like most about the thEQblue is the sound. As a mastering engineer who chooses to work in the analog domain, all of my adjustments are Out-of-the-Box with analog hardware. For me, this has always had the feel and presentation that I am looking for in my work for my clients. However, the thEQblue is the first plug-in I have used that actually feels like an analog piece of hardware. When I make an adjustment with the thEQblue, I get the sense of turning knobs on my outboard gear. The way that the gain and slope react has a very known, comfortable feel to it.<br>
          This is not a transparent EQ. If that’s what you desire, MAAT’s <a href="https://www.maat.digital/theqorange/" target="_blank">thEQorange</a> will greatly impress. thEQblue’s subtle to more apparent tonal color, for me, represents the best of a very powerful and adjustable analog EQ, in a digital platform. Very well done MAAT! I dig it, and would highly recommend it to anyone who may struggle with the use of plugins where they were wanting to use hardware before.”</em></p>
          <h5>Stephan Mathieu, Schwebung Mastering</h5>
          <p><em>“thEQorange became my unrivaled critical EQ from day one on, period. Now that I’ve added thEQblue to my strictly selected palette of ITB processors, I can say that I’ve found my absolute dream team. So very well done, and I can’t wait for your version of the LP SplitComp to arrive, which most likely means that I’ll be able do all my ITB work with those three products. Maximal minimalism, my dream for 25 years coming true.<br>
          You know, the last 3 days I found the time to really deal with blue, and yesterday I started to become really excited with the MAAT EQ team. Not like having found a new toy, but having found a solution. I’m working all day with plugins since ’96 and something I’ve learned quickly is that I don’t want to use most of them but try to master only a handful instead. Here I go, and thanks again for that…Keep up the brilliant work.”</em></p>
          <h5>Sean Diggins, Digital Diggo Mastering</h5>
          <p><em>“thEQblue is a sleek, blue-sky clean “curve machine.” It's always about the curves and blue has the lot.”</em></p>
          <h5>Arpad Tchiba, engineer for award–winning classical pianist Martin Tchiba</h5>
          <p><em>“…Excellent, overwhelming! and looks beautiful. Thanks very much. It was absolutely worth waiting for.”</em></p>
        <h4>thEQblue actually improves on the original Classic PEQ Blue, with increased precision for even finer low amplitude detail, as does our SantaCruzEQ since it uses the same algorithms.</h4>
          <h5>Bob Olhsson (Gearslutz) on the original Classic PEQ Blue</h5>
          <p><em>“I still use blue and red…Blue and red remain unsurpassed sound-wise.”</em></p>
          <h5>TKFP (Gearslutz) on the original Classic PEQ Blue</h5>
          <p><em>“You know mixing without blue, is like cereals without milk. So many good and usable EQs out there. Lets face it. Im a sucker for that good EQ tho. I really rely on it. I dont wanna see my new system running without it. That Algo stuff is still untouched. Its really good. Really good.”</em></p>

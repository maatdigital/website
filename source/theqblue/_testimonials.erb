          <h6>TKFP (Gearslutz) on the original Classic PEQ Blue</h6>
          <p><em>“You know mixing without blue, is like cereals without milk. So many good and usable EQs out there. Lets face it. Im a sucker for that good EQ tho. I really rely on it. I dont wanna see my new system running without it. That Algo stuff is still untouched. Its really good. Really good.”</em></p>

        <h3>
          Truly the Only Way to Measure DR </h3>
        <p>
          MAAT’s DROffline batch measurement app is the only software that generates official DR readings. Offering essential options for 
          musically justified, file–based metering, DROffline includes DR dynamic range, SPPM Peak and RMS amplitude. One file can be evaluated,
          or an entire directory can be measured in batch mode.
          </p>
          <h3>
          What is DR?</h3>
        <p>
          The DR algorithm, akin to PLR (Peak–to–Loudness Ratio) or “crest factor,” specifically measures the dynamic density or lack of dynamics caused
          by overly aggressive dynamic compression and limiting. Although the companion DRMeter provides an estimate of the "official" DR Value, only
          the DROffline utility can generate official values, which are cumulative over the entire length of a song. Only DROffline can scrub through an
          entire song or track, resulting in an official DR number.
          </p>
        <p>
          The complete DR metering system, composed of the realtime DRMeter plus the DROffline batch processor, was created by Friedemann Tischmeyer to 
          address the need to generate a repeatable, easy to understand numeric value. Seeing a meaningful and easy to understand indication of dynamic 
          range inspires users to back away from hyper compression.

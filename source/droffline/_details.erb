          <h3>Truly the Only Way to Measure DR</h3>
          <p>
            MAAT’s DROffline batch measurement app is the only software that generates official DR readings. Offering essential options
            for musically justified, file–based metering, DROffline includes DR dynamic range, SPPM Peak and RMS amplitude. One file can
            be evaluated, or an entire directory can be measured in batch mode.

        <h3>What is DR?</h3>
        <p class="margin-b-20">
          The DR algorithm, akin to PLR (Peak–to–Loudness Ratio) or “crest factor,” specifically measures the dynamic
          density or lack of dynamics caused by overly aggressive dynamic compression and limiting. Although the companion DRMeter
          provides an estimate of the "official" DR Value, only the DROffline utility can generate official values, which are cumulative
          over the entire length of a song. Only DROffline can scrub through an entire song or track, resulting in an official DR number.

          </br>
          The complete DR metering system, composed of the realtime DRMeter plus the DROffline batch processor, was
          created by Friedemann Tischmeyer to address the need to generate a repeatable, easy to understand numeric value. Seeing a
          meaningful and easy to understand indication of dynamic range inspires users to back away from hyper compression.

        <h3>Not Only The Doctor Has a Companion</h3>
        <p class="margin-b-20">
        The MAAT DROffline release is MAAT’s second step in bringing forward the
          legacy of the PMF’s legendary TT Dynamic Range metering system, which was
          certainly the most popular metering plug—in of the last decade. DROffline
          has be modernized to work with current version of Windows and MacOS operating systems.

          </br>
           The companion DRMeter is a plug-in that generates approximate DR
          values when applied to the loudest passages in a track. Due to its
          realtime operation, it cannot measure official DR values, but it can
          estimate DR while you work. To download your copy of DRMeter, head over to ...

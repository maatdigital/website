        <h3>Testimonial</h3>
          <h5>Timo Wildenhain, Head of Professional Audio at Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH, on LIN OEM</h5>
          <p>Wildenhain is dedicated to functionality and fidelity, shepherding their pro business into a worldwide phenomenon. “We have chosen LINpro dithering for our high-end mastering software WaveLab Pro 11 (and Cubase) because we didn’t want to make any compromises regarding sound quality and ease of use.” His opinion is unequivocal. “LIN is simply the best dithering on the market.”</em>

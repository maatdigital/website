        <h4>Praise for the original Algorithmix LinearPhase PEQ Red</h4>
        <p>thEQred is a modern restoration of the original <em>Linear Phase PEQ Red</em> from Algorithmix. Thanks
          to improvements in technology since “Red” was released, our new version exceeds the already
          legendary fidelity of the original. Plus, we’ve added key new tech to the User Experience (UX) to make your
          time with thEQred easier and more pleasurable.</p>
        <h5>Robert “Bob” Olhsson via GearSlutz (Smokey Robinson, Temptations, Steve Roach, Marvin Gaye)</h5>
        <p><em>“I still use blue and red…Blue and red remain unsurpassed sound-wise.”</em></p>
        <h5>Sakis Anastopoulos, Digisound Mastering</h5>
        <p><em>“I must tell you that I am absolutely ecstatic with the results that I have been achieving with the
          linear phase EQs…Both Red and Orange EQs have absolutely replaced every other EQ that I own and have given
          me the ability and freedom to perform challenging frequency adjustment tasks in every project that I master
          no matter how challenging or what genre it is…Their ability to resolve with accuracy, clarity and
          musicality, frequency ranges in complex music passages is astonishing, allowing the mastering engineer to
          focus on the project and forget the artifacts that are usually associated with this kind of processors.”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Graemme Brown, Zen Mastering</h5>
        <p><em>“I have spent most of my time with the red version of the LinearPhase PEQ and can honestly say that it is the best sounding software EQ that I have ever heard!”</em></p>
        <h5>Bob Katz, Digital Domain</h5>
        <p><em>“…the Algorithmix Red and Orange Linear Phase equalizers are must haves.”</em></p>
        <h5>Alan Silverman, Arf! Digital</h5>
        <p><em>“The depth and punch of the lows and the air and silkiness of the highs are by far the best by far in my experience. A new benchmark…This has now become my default high and low EQ. Chaka (Khan) said the CD sounded incredible and her producer said the lows and highs were ‘amazing.’”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Eric James, reviewing in Sound On Sound magazine</h5>
        <p><em>“Red offers totally transparent control of the whole sonic spectrum. Red’s Continuous Slope function on shelving filters is very useful, especially in mastering…Algorithmix's Red mastering EQ is comparable in quality to the best digital hardware units at a fraction of their price.”</em></p>
        <h5>T-Dogg on our Dr. Christoph’s chops (via GearSlutz)</h5>
        <p><em>“The real gurus in the field…Dr. Christoph Musialik, etc. have far surpassed these textbook
          algorithms…Simply put, genius–level R&D and know–how is priceless.”</em> We concur and know that you will
          too!

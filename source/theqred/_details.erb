          <h3>EQ Nobility</h3>
          <p>
            Think of thEQred as LP PEQ Red 2.0…we’ve taken the fundamentals of Algorithmix’s exemplary LinearPhase PEQ Red, and given it a MAAT makeover. There’s nothing retro about this reissue, with twelve bands of precision, linear phase parametric equalization featuring unique shelving filters for mastery of complex mixes without changing their overall sonic character.<br>
            Every mastering engineer knows that equalization of a complex mix or minimalist acoustic recording is critical and usually limited to small adjustment. Any correction of a single instrument or vocal influences other instruments and tonal balance, negatively affecting the sound. Why? Classic equalizers change the phase of the fundamentals and harmonics and that phase shift is frequency–dependent. Being linear phase, thEQred does not shift phase, it only boosts or cuts amplitude. This means you can apply much more boost without changing the signature sonics of your material. Thanks to our proprietary, low–noise filter design, distortion and noise (THD+N) is extremely low, ensuring crystal clear sound quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most all parametric equalizers or PEQs are implemented via phase shift. That is, the incoming dry signal is mixed with a phase–shifted version. Because the amount of the phase shift is frequency dependent, some cancellation or reinforcement occurs at the desired frequency. It gets the job done, but with a major disadvantage: the different signal components of the resulting audio become spread out in time, so time relationships between harmonics in the filtered output is heavily altered. The result: a nice sharp attack becomes slurred and muddy or worse, strident and brittle.<br>
            thEQred changes all that, providing profoundly punchy lows and airy, silky smooth highs like no other. It preserves the time relationships of harmonics, which translates into a smoother top end, sweeter and bigger midrange, and a clearer, more distinct bottom when compared to phase–shift style EQs. The resultant sound seems less processed, more like what should have naturally been captured by the microphone. Mixes become clear and transparent, while instruments take on more definition and realism. Boost lows by 10 dB without mud or loss of transient snap. Remove sibilance from a vocal with a sharp notch without affecting the whole mix. You won’t get those punchy lows and silky highs with analog outboard or an IIR digital.<br>
            Experts say that most digital EQs don’t sound like their analog antecedents, especially when working with baseband 44.1 or 48k sample rates. Spectrum modifications of high frequencies sound unbalanced. The reason is so–called “frequency warping,” which makes bell shapes asymmetric, while high shelves and cuts exhibit steeper slopes than expected. In thEQred, special corrections have been applied, making them look exactly like their analog counterparts while yielding a smooth analog sound. In addition to all the user–forward features that MAAT brings you, like Panorama and Contribution controls, thEQred features VariSlope™ technology, proprietary to thEQr. With VariSlope, shelving and cut filters offer continuous adjustment of any slope in the range from 0 to 24 dB/octave. Unlike other EQs that let you define or draw the curve, VariSlope offers unique versatility while preserving the sound quality MAAT EQs are known for.

          <h4>Red vs Orange</h4>
          <p>
            thEQred works strictly in the frequency domain, while sounding a bit softer than her linear phase sister, thEQorange. Performing at up to 384 kHz which extends frequency settings up to 80 kHz, this makes it perfect for high resolution DSD, DXD and game audio post–production. Its calculations are stored at 80 bits of precision, more than double what commodity EQs manage. The result: the construction of your composite filter is impeccable, without loss of low amplitude detail..

          <h3>Unobtrusive Power</h3>
          <p>
            Hiding behind DRMeter MkII’s seemingly simple UI is a powerful premise. Eye candy is great for newbies, but can really get you down on a daily basis. DRMeter MkII packs every metric you may need into one resizable window that’s easy on the eyes. Not only does the UI “get out of the way,” so you can be more productive, we’ve incorporated industry–first features that inform you of possible pitfalls without slapping you in the face.
          </p>
          <h4>Subtle Functionality</h4>
          <p>
            DRMeter MkII combines all mandated Loudness metrics with several new twists. We’ve added discrete left/right measurements so you can ID channel–specific trouble spots and track trends. We also measure all the time for all metrics, in the background, so you can jump from one measurement method to another and back, checking up on specific concerns without loosing the overall picture. We’ve even added little details that make your day better, like digital black indicators; Play, Pause and automatic controls for integrated measurement; an R128 Gate Disable for downward compatibility; and a True Peak disable option for you broadcast folks that need SPPM as well. Did we mention user presets so you can blip between client or program–specific settings in an instant?

        <h3>Better By Design</h3>
        <p class="margin-b-20">
            We’ve included a round trip AAC codec, the same one iTunes uses, into our measurement and monitoring options so your MfiT work will be spot on every time, while Dynamic Deviation allows you to navigate within the “gravitation field” between peak and loudness normalization. By setting your personal Target Loudness level and a True Peak Threshold, you get instant feedback on positive or negative differences relative to your defined “Dynamic Margin.”<br>
            Dynamic Margin equals Target Loudness minus TP Threshold and, BTW, the use of “deviation” is significant. Positive values indicate more dynamic content than your Dynamic Margin, while negative values indicate less dynamic content.

        <h3>Loudness Metering Evolved</h3>
        <p>Since the invention of the initial TT Dynamic Range meter, things have improved in the global audio metering marketplace. We now have world standards for True Peak, Loudness and Dynamic metrics, defined in ITU BS 1770 and applied in practice thanks to the European Broadcasting Union’s R128 and the Advanced Television Systems Committee’s A/85 standards. Though designed for broadcast audio, this has had a huge impact on the whole world of production and distribution, not only broadcasting. Amazingly, we have reliable, predictable and globally interoperable algorithms and parameters, bringing “Loudness Normalization” into even the world of global music distribution.
        </p>
        <h4>Who Needs DR Metering</h4>
        <p>We had to ask ourselves, “Does the world really need the DRMeter anymore?” The clear answer is, “Fer sure, dude!” Why? Because LRA or Loudness Range, as specified in BS.1770-4, aims to reflect the dynamics of broadband material being distributed by television broadcasters. The LRA algorithm excludes the top 5% of the dynamic band, which is uninteresting for broadcasters working with generous headroom. However, that same top 5% of the whole dynamic range capacity of a system, is essential for music as its content happens almost exclusively in this upper 5% region. DR is the only algorithm for measuring the dynamic integrity of music releases.
        </p>
        <h4>Metering For Normalization Targets</h4>
        <p>Spotify, YouTube and many other streaming music platforms are working with Program Loudness, along with TV broadcasters worldwide plus an increasing number of OTT (“Over–The–Top” streaming providers like Netflix and HBO Go) and even traditional radio broadcasters. iTunes Music and iTunes Match uses a proprietary algorithm which is pretty close to Integrated Loudness mentioned above. We really don’t need another player in the field of loudness normalization, but we do need a universal yardstick for dynamic density; the DR Dynamic Range algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>DR is a tool not only for pro audio peeps but your audience as well, especially audiophiles, since DR is used by music enthusiasts to judge and compare the provenance of music releases. Our DR database records the values of tens of thousands of songs and albums, so the public can compare different releases and remastered versions.
        </p>
        <h4>What About PLR</h4>
        <p>Lately, there are plenty of meters showing PLR or Peak–to–Loudness Ratio, the difference between Peak and Loudness values. Wouldn’t this be a good alternative? Nope, because PLR has been defined by broadcasters to reflects the True Peak–to–integrated Loudness Ratio. This makes sense for broadcasters dealing with a minimum True Peak headroom of 1 dB (R128) or 2 dB (A/85). That said, using PLR for music makes no sense because many masters show True Peak overs of up to +3 dB, and information above 0 dBFS encodes latent distortion but not dynamics or loudness. A better alternative would be PSR or Sample Peak (SPPM)–to–Short–term Loudness Ratio. PSR has been defined in the AES Convention e-Brief 373. In order to deliver a complete metering solution, we have integrated the PSR algorithm into DRMeter MkII so that you can compare PSR with DR. The major shortcoming of PSR is the inability to consider macro dynamics due to the absence of gating and the like, which leads to a higher misrepresentation of dynamic density. So, songs with high macrodynamic would be far louder. Also, interpretation of values is impossible unless you know the inherent macrodynamics. As an example: Say you have a song with an acoustic guitar intro and a very dynamic interlude but a chorus crushed into “toothpaste,” the PSR would give us a moderately high value due to the dynamic intro and interlude. This is solved with DRM2, as you can actually measure the lack of dynamic range while you hear it.
        </p>
        <h4>The Measurements</h4>
       <ol>
          <li>The DR bar graph of DRMeter MkII is the same as the original TT DR Meter plug–in and MAAT’s DRMeter. If you want to get a quick sense of the final integrated DR (DR<em>i</em>), you have now two options: Go to the loudest sustained part of a song, often the chorus, and read the numeric value above the bar graph. It will be quite close to an integrated DR measurement, which you’d get from our DROffline batch utility. The new option is to use DRM2’s exclusive DR<em>i</em> function. Run the chorus of your song to get a quick estimate of the official DR<em>i</em>. When you’re done with a track, run the whole song and stop playback. The official integer DR<em>i</em> value will be displayed at the bottom of the DR bar graph. This inclusion of DROffline’s functionality will make your work day go faster!
          </li>
          <li>The emerging PSR measurement method displays the current Peak–to–Short–term Loudness Ratio for those who want to have a comparison or reference. For the sake of harmonization with existing standards, it makes sense to use Short–term for loudness measurement, and SPPM (Sample Peak Program Metering) for the PSR peak measurement.<br>
            Be careful: With no standard, PLR measurements are not harmonized. So, different manufacturer’s meters may show varying results, with each showing its own values for the same audio source. Many use RMS instead of Short–term LU. The difference between PLR and DR is simple: PLR is the difference between peak and average, and is <em>not</em> standardized, while DR is always, repeatably DR. Also, DR ignores low amplitude information, so called “background loudness,” for the sake of a more predictable measurement result. Plus, the DR algorithm also incorporates additional processing for meaningful measurement of the dynamic integrity and dynamic density of popular music.
          </li>
          <li>LRA or Loudness Range was designed to reflect the deviation of loudness events primarily for broadcast applications. Unfortunately, LRA isn’t ideal for evaluating loudness of pop and other styles of music since most of recorded music happens in a range of amplitude which is ignored by the mandated LRA algorithm. So, for universality, we have included LRA for broadcast engineers and those of you who want to be more familiar with metering standards and their applications. The LRA meter allows you to compare results with both DR and PSR.

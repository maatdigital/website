          Clad in a stainless steel skin, MAAT’s CmStick from Wibu Systems provides portability, convenience and flexibility in how and where you deploy your licenses. The all metal case prevents unforeseen damage that could slow you down, and are so small they won’t weigh down your already overloaded key chain.<br>
          Our dongles work with all Wibu licenses that use the current generation of CmStick, and are required for MAAT’s thEQ series of matchless, ultra–resolution equalizers.<br>
          As an incentive to move to hardware license storage, every MAAT dongle ships with a US$50 voucher for use on our ecommerce site. So, improve your business agility, and move up to the best way to store your licenses: a MAAT CmStick!

          Usable metering is another essential for any engineer, and options are equally practical, with stereo balance and inter-channel
          correlation occupying the upper half of the user interface. Unlike prior products that provide similar metering functions, 2BusControl´s measurement and display algorithms adhere to our guiding philosophy of enhancing your workflow and improving ergonomics through careful attention to the way you actually work. Ballistics are meticulously
          tuned to achieve the best match between the aural impression you hear and the optical rendering by the meters.

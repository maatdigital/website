          <h6>Sakis Anastopoulos, Digisound Mastering</h6>
          <p><em>“I must tell you that I am absolutely ecstatic with the results that I have been achieving with the linear phase EQs…Both Red and Orange EQs have absolutely replaced every other EQ that I own and have given me the ability and freedom to perform challenging frequency adjustment tasks in every project that I master no matter how challenging or what genre it is…Their ability to resolve with accuracy, clarity and musicality, frequency ranges in complex music passages is astonishing, allowing the mastering engineer to focus on the project and forget the artifacts that are usually associated with this kind of processors.”</em></p>
          <h6>Stefan Lindstrom, Swedish Sound Reference AB</h6>
          <p><em>“Having the ($6k) hardware Weiss Linear Phase EQ1-MK2 as the reference, I've never expected to hear any other product, especially a software PlugIn, playing in the same league, but the LinearPhase PEQ Orange became to be an indispensable complement tool in our mastering suite.”</em></p>
          <h6>Bob Katz, Digital Domain</h6>
          <p><em>“…the Algorithmix Red and Orange Linear Phase equalizers are must haves.”</em></p>
          <h6>Alan Silverman, Arf! Digital</h6>
          <p><em>“…as the final touch-up EQ…the sound is fantastic!”</em></p>
          <h6>T-Dogg on our Dr. Christoph’s chops</h6>
          <p><em>“The real gurus in the field…Dr. Christoph Musialik, etc. have far surpassed these textbook algorithms…Simply put, genius–level R&D and know–how is priceless.”</em> We concur and know that you will too!</p>

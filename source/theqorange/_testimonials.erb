        <h3>Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
        <h5>Thom Wettstein, Mondstein Records</h5>
        <p><em>“I have tried thEQorange in every mastering. Sometimes it fits, sometimes not.<br>
        I like the features of re-ordering the bands and listening just to the cuts or boosts. It’s easy to find the sweet spot. I like the Interface a lot. It's comfortable to work with. The strength of this plug–in, in my opinion, is the de-masking of the mid frequencies. It’s very transparent.”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Patrik Schwitter (organ builder, musician, educator, award–winning mastering engineer)</h5>
        <p><em>“It just sounds fantastic or, to be more clear, it does not have any sound (i.e. colouration) at all! I'm totally convinced of this orange beauty. :) ”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Tomi Kuusisto, Audio Chef Mastering (EMI Finland, Warner Music)</h5>
        <p><em>“The search for the ultimate EQ is finally over. I have to say that you really nailed it with thEQorange!<br>
        It is more than an awesome tool for mastering as well as for mixing. I have tried all the mainstream pro plugin EQs out there but thEQorange is something unique; transparent and very musical…The show is not over until the thEQorange sings!”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Олег Ершов (Oleg “Yorshoff” Yershov), engineer & journalist</h5>
        <p><em>“This thEQo is simply insane! I’m shocked how good it is…(my) overall impression is just WOW!”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Oleg released a video overview and review of thEQorange. His conclusion, <em>“It amazes with the functionality and sound quality of its algorithms…Comparing thEQorange with other equalizers, using it for solving various problems during mixing and mastering, I continue to (think) this equalizer is really the king among digital equalizers.”</em><br>

        </p>
        <p>He also wrote a piece on thEQorange for the Russian edition of FutureMusic. In it, he states that, <em>“Again, if the original PEQ Orange stood out from the competition mainly due to its technical characteristics (first of all, its (sound) quality)…Friedemann and his colleagues at MAAT were able to make thEQorange a user-friendly device, be it a home musician or a professional mastering engineer of world class - high demands and expectations…<br>
            Having spent enough time with thEQorange, I really enjoyed this (plug–in) - it works easily, quickly and with pleasure. Is it worth the money? I think that everyone should answer this question on their own but I, in turn, do not plan to abandon this plug-in and continue with great pleasure to use it in my mixes.</em>”

        <h4>Praise for the original Algorithmix LinearPhase PEQ Orange</h4>
        <p>thEQorange is a modern restoration of the original <em>Linear Phase PEQ Orange</em> from Algorithmix. Thanks
          to improvements in technology since the PEQ Orange was released, our new version exceeds the already
          legendary fidelity of the original. Plus, we’ve added key new tech to the UX (User Experience) to make your
          time with thEQorange easier and more pleasurable.</p>
        <h6>Sakis Anastopoulos, Digisound Mastering</h6>
        <p><em>“I must tell you that I am absolutely ecstatic with the results that I have been achieving with the
          linear phase EQs…Both Red and Orange EQs have absolutely replaced every other EQ that I own and have given
          me the ability and freedom to perform challenging frequency adjustment tasks in every project that I master
          no matter how challenging or what genre it is…Their ability to resolve with accuracy, clarity and
          musicality, frequency ranges in complex music passages is astonishing, allowing the mastering engineer to
          focus on the project and forget the artifacts that are usually associated with this kind of processors.”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>Stefan Lindstrom, Swedish Sound Reference AB</h6>
        <p><em>“Having the ($6k) hardware Weiss Linear Phase EQ1-MK2 as the reference, I've never expected to hear any
          other product, especially a software PlugIn, playing in the same league, but the LinearPhase PEQ Orange
          became to be an indispensable complement tool in our mastering suite.”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>Bob Katz, Digital Domain</h6>
        <p><em>“…the Algorithmix Red and Orange Linear Phase equalizers are must haves.”</em></p>
        <h6>Alan Silverman, Arf! Digital</h6>
        <p><em>“…as the final touch-up EQ…the sound is fantastic!”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>T-Dogg on our Dr. Christoph’s chops</h6>
        <p><em>“The real gurus in the field…Dr. Christoph Musialik, etc. have far surpassed these textbook
          algorithms…Simply put, genius–level R&D and know–how is priceless.”</em> We concur and know that you will
          too!

        <h3>Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
        <h5>Олег Ершов (Oleg “Yorshoff” Yershov), engineer & journalist</h5>
        <p><em>This thEQo is simply insane! I’m shocked how good it is…(my) overall impression is just WOW!</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Praise for the original Algorithmix LinearPhase PEQ Orange</h5>
        <p>thEQorange is a modern restoration of the original <em>Linear Phase PEQ Orange</em> from Algorithmix. Thanks
          to improvements in technology since the PEQ Orange was released, our new version exceeds the already
          legendary fidelity of the original. Plus, we’ve added key new tech to the UX (User Experience) to make your
          time with thEQorange easier and more pleasurable.</p>
        <h6>Sakis Anastopoulos, Digisound Mastering</h6>
        <p><em>“I must tell you that I am absolutely ecstatic with the results that I have been achieving with the
          linear phase EQs…Both Red and Orange EQs have absolutely replaced every other EQ that I own and have given
          me the ability and freedom to perform challenging frequency adjustment tasks in every project that I master
          no matter how challenging or what genre it is…Their ability to resolve with accuracy, clarity and
          musicality, frequency ranges in complex music passages is astonishing, allowing the mastering engineer to
          focus on the project and forget the artifacts that are usually associated with this kind of processors.”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>Stefan Lindstrom, Swedish Sound Reference AB</h6>
        <p><em>“Having the ($6k) hardware Weiss Linear Phase EQ1-MK2 as the reference, I've never expected to hear any
          other product, especially a software PlugIn, playing in the same league, but the LinearPhase PEQ Orange
          became to be an indispensable complement tool in our mastering suite.”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>Bob Katz, Digital Domain</h6>
        <p><em>“…the Algorithmix Red and Orange Linear Phase equalizers are must haves.”</em></p>
        <h6>Alan Silverman, Arf! Digital</h6>
        <p><em>“…as the final touch-up EQ…the sound is fantastic!”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>T-Dogg on our Dr. Christoph’s chops</h6>
        <p><em>“The real gurus in the field…Dr. Christoph Musialik, etc. have far surpassed these textbook
          algorithms…Simply put, genius–level R&D and know–how is priceless.”</em> We concur and know that you will
          too!

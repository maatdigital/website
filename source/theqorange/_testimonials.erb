        <h3>Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
        <h5>Athanasius Ditsias, Digisound Studios</h5>
        <p><em>“The EQorange far surpasses any other plug–in, including Equilibrium or my original battle horse, PLPar. End of story. The musical information passing the filters is way more transparent, far more analog sounding, less fatiguing and almost identical to the Weiss. thEQorange will definitely be THE EQ for the next ten years. Waiting hopefully for thEQblue, red, the compressor/limiter, reNOVAtor, Denoiser and Declicker!”</em></p>
        <h5>Thomas Meitz, Editing Department Head at Vienna Symphonic Library GmbH</h5>
        <p><em>“Zuerst muss mal gesagt werden, dass thEQorange wirklich einfach Spaß macht!<br>
        Ich habe bereits einige Projekte damit bearbeitet und es ist wirklich einfach zum richtigen Ergebnis zu kommen!<br>
        Einerseits weil der EQ so schön „nichtfärbt“, andererseits sind die Zusatzfeatures ausgezeichnete Hilfsmittel.<br>
        Die Bearbeitung im Bassbereich ent-mumpft grandios und ein High-Shelf im Differenzsignal macht schön breit ohne irgendwie scharf zu werden!<br>
        Nach anfänglicher Skepsis: Ich liebe das Spektrogramm!<br>
        Die Solofunktion der Gain-Änderungen finde ich super, muss damit aber noch warm werden.<br>
        Snap-Funktion bei Rechtsklick auf die Pianoroll ist sehr praktisch.<br>
        Sort-Funktion = Spitzenmäßig!<br>
        Ich finde das GUI super aufgeräumt, beschriftet wo notwendig und intuitiv!<br>
        Skalieren ist super und zeitgemäß – ich kenne allerdings kein Plugin das IMMER gleich gut aussieht – das geht wahrscheinlich nicht…<br>
        <br>
        <b>In Summe: Ich gratuliere zu einem hervorragenden EQ!</b>”</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>“First of all, it has to be said that thEQorange is really fun!<br>
        I've already done some projects on it and it's really easy to get the right results!<br>
        On the one hand, the EQ is nicely neutral and does not “color,” on the other, the additional features are excellent tools.<br>
        The editing in the bass range de-clutters terrific and a high-shelf on the difference signal makes beautiful wide without any kind of sharpness!<br>
        After initial skepticism: I love the spectrogram!<br>
        I think the solo feature of the monitor section with positive and negative gain changes is great, but I still need to get used to it.<br>
        Snap function on right-click on the piano roll is very convenient.<br>
        Sort function = Tops!<br>
        I think the GUI is super clean, labeled where necessary and intuitive!<br>
        Scaling is great and up to date - but I do not know a plug–in that ALWAYS looks the same - that probably will not work…<br>
        <br>
        <b>In summary: I congratulate you on an excellent EQ!</b>”</em>

        <h5>Andrea Zanini, CEO & Chief Mastering Engineer at Owl Mastering</h5>
        <p><em>“Some digital plug–ins deliver precision, while others deliver musicality. thEQorange is definitely a juicy tool, squeezing both qualities in a single, exquisite piece of audio engineering.”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Thom Wettstein, Mondstein Records</h5>
        <p><em>“I have tried thEQorange in every mastering. Sometimes it fits, sometimes not.<br>
        I like the features of re-ordering the bands and listening just to the cuts or boosts. It’s easy to find the sweet spot. I like the Interface a lot. It's comfortable to work with. The strength of this plug–in, in my opinion, is the de-masking of the mid frequencies. It’s very transparent.”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Patrik Schwitter (organ builder, musician, educator, award–winning mastering engineer)</h5>
        <p><em>“It just sounds fantastic or, to be more clear, it does not have any sound (i.e. colouration) at all! I'm totally convinced of this orange beauty. :) ”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Tomi Kuusisto, Audio Chef Mastering (EMI Finland, Warner Music)</h5>
        <p><em>“The search for the ultimate EQ is finally over. I have to say that you really nailed it with thEQorange!<br>
        It is more than an awesome tool for mastering as well as for mixing. I have tried all the mainstream pro plugin EQs out there but thEQorange is something unique; transparent and very musical…The show is not over until the thEQorange sings!”</em>
        </p>
        <h5>Олег Ершов (Oleg “Yorshoff” Yershov, engineer & journalist)</h5>
        <p><em>“This thEQo is simply insane! I’m shocked how good it is…(my) overall impression is just WOW!”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Oleg released a video overview and review of thEQorange. His conclusion, <em>“It amazes with the functionality and sound quality of its algorithms…Comparing thEQorange with other equalizers, using it for solving various problems during mixing and mastering, I continue to (think) this equalizer is really the king among digital equalizers.”</em><br>

        </p>
        <p>He also wrote a piece on thEQorange for the Russian edition of FutureMusic. In it, he states that, <em>“Again, if the original PEQ Orange stood out from the competition mainly due to its technical characteristics (first of all, its (sound) quality)…Friedemann and his colleagues at MAAT were able to make thEQorange a user-friendly device, be it a home musician or a professional mastering engineer of world class - high demands and expectations…<br>
            Having spent enough time with thEQorange, I really enjoyed this (plug–in) - it works easily, quickly and with pleasure. Is it worth the money? I think that everyone should answer this question on their own but I, in turn, do not plan to abandon this plug-in and continue with great pleasure to use it in my mixes.</em>”<br>

        <h5>Benoît Piccand, studio head & faculty lecturer in the Music Division of Bern University of the Arts</h5>
        <p><em>“After the first few days of experimenting with thEQorange: I am really thrilled; on the one hand, by the tonal results, but also by the interface: simple, extremely pragmatic and equipped with maximally useful functions. Unique and very beneficial!<br>
I'm curious to see and hear what the other family members (blue and red?) have to offer.”</em>

        <h4>Praise for the original Algorithmix LinearPhase PEQ Orange</h4>
        <p>thEQorange is a modern restoration of the original <em>Linear Phase PEQ Orange</em> from Algorithmix. Thanks
          to improvements in technology since the PEQ Orange was released, our new version exceeds the already
          legendary fidelity of the original. Plus, we’ve added key new tech to the UX (User Experience) to make your
          time with thEQorange easier and more pleasurable.</p>
        <h6>Sakis Anastopoulos, Digisound Mastering</h6>
        <p><em>“I must tell you that I am absolutely ecstatic with the results that I have been achieving with the
          linear phase EQs…Both Red and Orange EQs have absolutely replaced every other EQ that I own and have given
          me the ability and freedom to perform challenging frequency adjustment tasks in every project that I master
          no matter how challenging or what genre it is…Their ability to resolve with accuracy, clarity and
          musicality, frequency ranges in complex music passages is astonishing, allowing the mastering engineer to
          focus on the project and forget the artifacts that are usually associated with this kind of processors.”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>Stefan Lindstrom, Swedish Sound Reference AB</h6>
        <p><em>“Having the ($6k) hardware Weiss Linear Phase EQ1-MK2 as the reference, I've never expected to hear any
          other product, especially a software PlugIn, playing in the same league, but the LinearPhase PEQ Orange
          became to be an indispensable complement tool in our mastering suite.”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>Bob Katz, Digital Domain</h6>
        <p><em>“…the Algorithmix Red and Orange Linear Phase equalizers are must haves.”</em></p>
        <h6>Alan Silverman, Arf! Digital</h6>
        <p><em>“…as the final touch-up EQ…the sound is fantastic!”</em>
        </p>
        <h6>T-Dogg on our Dr. Christoph’s chops</h6>
        <p><em>“The real gurus in the field…Dr. Christoph Musialik, etc. have far surpassed these textbook
          algorithms…Simply put, genius–level R&D and know–how is priceless.”</em> We concur and know that you will
          too!

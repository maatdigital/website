          <h3>The Budget Way to Estimate DR Dynamic Range</h3>
          <p>
            The best selling DRMeter from MAAT offers essential options for musically responsive, real time level metering. These include graphical and numeric estimation of DR dynamic range, plus measurement of SPPM Peak, RMS amplitude, digital overs and “digital black.” Our DRMeter release was MAAT’s first step in bringing forward the legacy of the PMF’s legendary TT Dynamic Range Meter, certainly the most popular metering plug—in of the last decade and one that engendered many inaccurate imitators. Inspiring music producers and artists worldwide for more dynamic music releases, DRMeter’s carefully tuned ballistics contributed to the original TT’s broad acceptance. Tested against the original TT DR Meter to ensure a consistent user experience, DRMeter is modern, supporting all major plug-in formats including VST 2/VST 3 and AAX for macOS and Windows plus UB2 Audio Units for macOS.

            Our groundbreaking follow–on to DRMeter, <a href="https://www.maat.digital/drm2/" target="_self">DRMeter MkII</a> features all modern metering algorithms, including true DR<em>i</em> and all EBU R 128 and ATSC A/85–mandated metrics along with some new thinking and measurements from the AES designed specifically for music mixers.

        <h3>MAAT To The Rescue</h3>
        <p class="margin-b-20">
        The DR meter is back! In conjunction with the PMF, we are the guys behind the Pleasurize Music Foundation, our geeks have sweated the details; testing and tweaking to make sure that you get the same familiar and much loved ballistics of the original TT DR Meter tool, which has already helped to preserve dynamics for thousands of modern pop releases and multiple millions of records sold. The only difference between the original and new DR meters is the removal of Correlation metering and the Mono Button. That was done in response to user requests, to reduce UI height so the new DRMeter takes up less screen real estate. We have implemented those functions in a free plug-in, our handy <a href="https://www.maat.digital/2buscontrol/" target="_self">2BusControl</a>, which also includes solo buttons for L, R, MONO & DIFF, plus a left-right flip button and a useful Balance meter.<br>
        Accurate, easy to understand metering is an essential for any engineer, and the DRMeter´s measurement and display algorithms adhere to our guiding philosophy of enhancing your workflow and improving ergonomics through careful attention to the way you actually work. Ballistics are meticulously tuned to achieve the best match between the aural impressions you hear, and the visual rendering by the meters. Likewise, the plug-in is "light weight," demanding a minimum of CPU resources so it won´t slow down your host.

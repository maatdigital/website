                                   The DR algorithm, akin to PLR (Peak–to–Loudness Ratio) or “crest factor,” specifically measures the dynamic density or lack of dynamics caused by overly aggressive dynamic compression and limiting. When the loudest spots of a song are measured, it gives the user an estimate for the "official" DR Value, measured with the companion DROffline. Seeing a meaningful and easy to understand indication of dynamic range inspires users to back away from hyper compression. The complete DR metering system, composed of the realtime DRMeter plus the DROffline batch processor, was created by Friedemann Tischmeyer to address the need to generate a repeatable, easy to understand numeric value. In response to the broadly publicized “Loudness Wars,” the PMF worked to raise awareness that oppressively compressed dynamics in pop music are not only counterproductive, but sound often like crap! Now legendary, the PMF’s TT DR Meter and its offline companion was created to provide a deterministic benchmark, and was used by thousands of engineers and consumers to measure and log the dynamic range of popular music releases around the world. Alas, as with all things digital, the TT DR Meter grew old. An update was needed…

                                   The DRMeter is a plug–in that generates approximate DR values when applied to the loudest passages in a track. Due to realtime operation, it cannot measure official DR values, which are cumulative over the entire length of a song. Only the companion DROffline batch measuring utility can scrub through an entire song or track, resulting in an official DR number. To download your copy of the DROffline utility, head over to...

                                    As an introduction to everyone in the audio community, we’re offering this rather useful plug–in at a very reasonable price. Your purchase includes a US$5 donation to the PMF so they can continue working toward a more dynamically exciting world of music. Thanks for visiting, and stay tuned for the DROffline batch measuring utility, the only software that generates official DR readings. We hope to be working with you more in the future, drop by often to see what’s new!

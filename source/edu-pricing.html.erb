      2BC multiCORR, RSPhaseShifter, DRMeter MkII, and DROffline MkII are great tools to incorporate into your audio engineering education and curriculum. We also invited you to use our manuals, which provide in depth discussions of best practices for each product, as well as the background theory that drives our applications.

          <h3>The Sound You Need…Fast</h3>
          <p>Streamlining workflows for spoken word, sound–for–picture, podcast and broadcast production, MtG automatically fills gaps, of any length, in edited tracks. The plug–in supplies smoothly looped audio, with controls for visualizing and defining loop fills, along with gain controls to seamlessly integrate the looped audio into your material.
          </p>
          <p>Use MtG to speed up creation of your music beds, ambience, actualities, foley and, of course, radio and TV audio; anywhere continuous seamless repetitive audio is needed. A cross–platform plug–in, MtG works in your favorite DAW at whatever sample rate you need. For radio, television and podcasting work, go with 44.1 or 48k. For game audio, cinematic production or whenever clarity and resolution is paramount, MtG handles up to 384 kHz with ease.
          </p>
          <p>Not all DAWs behave the same, and MtG knows that. It includes safeguards that inform you if your DAW isn’t ready to play nice with MtG, reducing error and frustration. MtG also includes zoom controls to quickly identify any inaudible and undesirable material you may want to remove from your loop.

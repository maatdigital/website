        <h5>Edwin Pfanzagl–Cardone — head of sound for the Salzburg Festival and inventor of the NEVATON BPT surround microphone</h5>
        <p><em>“2BC multiCORR is a great tool for judging what goes on in terms of correlation versus frequency in your stereo mix. We know, from psychoacoustic research by various authors, that a high degree of signal de–correlation, especially in the frequency range below 500 Hz, is vital to achieve good spatial impression in recordings. MAAT’s 2BC multiCORR provides perfect real-time visual information on that aspect.”</em></p>
        <h5>Pedro Chamorro — composer, music producer and engineer</h5>
        <p><em>“I’m in love with that (2BC multiCORR). It makes clear which small phase corrections I could do to some tracks that made everything more focused and controlled.”</em>

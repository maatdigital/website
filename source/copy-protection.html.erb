    <p class="lead mb0">
      Yes, we all know that copy protection is a pain in the butt for everyone,
      for both you and us as well.</br>
      Before we made a final decision on our copy protection system, we have
      carefully researched the market to offer you the most convenient and
      flexible solution. We found that in Wibu-Systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      For all of our products under a certain price threshold, you have the
        option to choose either host–based soft licensing via a resident license
        file, or dongle–based licensing. Both options give you the freedom to
        carry the tools with you, to an outside gig or to your home.
    </p>

    <p>
      While our CodeMeter <a href="https://www.maat.digital/dongle/" target="_blank">CmStick</a> dongles 
      are portable and the easiest to use, our soft licensing option also
      provides portability. You simply need to retain your purchase ticket, and
      can “give back” the license to the license depot in order to “park it”
      in the cloud. You must do that from the host system where your products are
      installed, by using the link in conjunction with the ticket which were
      both supplied in your purchase confirmation. Afterwards, you can license
      our products temporarily or long term on any other host computer system.
    </p>

    <h3>Floating Server Licenses:</h3>
    <p>
      If you have a bigger studio complex and your DAWs are connected through a
      server, we can offer floating server licenses on request. If you have e.g.
      10 studios but you need not more than 5 licenses at any given time, you
      can have all of our tools on all systems and the server would monitor the
      used instances. Please ask sales@maat.digital for details.

    <h3>Why Copy Protection Is Important For You:</h3>
    <p>
      Good copy protection gives you two major advantageous:
    </p>

    <ol class="margin-b-40">
      <li><strong>Your investment is protected.</strong> We offer high performance, high value products with extraordinary audio quality based on decades of research. Our thEQ family is an example. By investing in these products, you acquire an advantage that your competitor doesn’t possess. Having
        weak copy protection empowers pirates to undermine your competitive
        advantage. For this reason, we make sure that just our customers have
        access to our tools. That’s also why our higher end products are dongle–only.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Your investment is maintained.</strong> In order to maintain a
        high quality DSP company, we need to pay high end, world leading DSP
        specialists. Pretty quickly, this leads to a six-figure burn rate! Our
        personnel are not only the backbone of our company, they’re the
        financial backbone of their families. Fraud kills jobs and communities
        in the creative digital world, and by using the best available copy
        protection, we’ll have the capacity to maintain your investment so it
        will continue to pay you back for decades to come.
      </li>
    </ol>

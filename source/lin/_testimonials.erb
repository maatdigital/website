        <h3>Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
          <h5>Timo Wildenhain, Head of Professional Audio at Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH</h5>
          <p><em>“We have chosen LINpro dithering for our high-end mastering software WaveLab Pro 11 because we didn't want to make any compromises regarding sound quality and ease of use. LIN is simply the best dithering on the market.”</em></p>
          <h5>R.S. - Indy engineer</h5>
          <p><em>“Just bought the LinnPro dither stereo version because that 9th order psychoacoustic dither is one of the most transparent dithers I’ve heard in a long time. I had been using the Sonalksis Ultimate Dither plugin set for mastering and either acoustic or hybrid material (which I think can be better than what iZotope offers). But the 9th order dither with rounding for 24 bit audio at 96K (mixing down from 32 bit float) is incredibly natural sounding. I think it also beats out the old Apogee UV22 dither (which Logic no longer bundles but Steinberg Wavelab includes it). UV22 always seemed like it did something special (in a good way) to the low end, but sometimes at the expense of the midrange and high end. But (LINpro’s) psychoacoustic dither seems to just evenly affect the entire spectrum.”</em></p>

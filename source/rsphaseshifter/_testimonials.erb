        <h5>Олег Ершов (Oleg Yershov) writes in the January 2018 issue of FutureMusic</h5>
        <p><em>“CONCLUSION</br>
        With the release of RSPhaseShifter, MAAT showed that, in the market for audio plug-ins, there was one more strong player with which it’s impossible to ignore. The quality of their algorithms proved to be extremely high, the design and aesthetics of the instruments do not raise any questions, and the ideas embodied in the products look very complex and, with respect to the past, look far into the future. The cost of RSPhaseShifter is $99, which is quite reasonable given the functionality and possible range of applications.</p>
        <p>Pros:</br>
        <ul>
	        <li>Phase correction up to 360°</li>
	        <li>Zero delay</li>
	        <li>Presence of DELTA (δ) function</li>
	        <li>Possibility of independent stereo operation</li>
	    </ul>
        Cons:</br>
        <ul>
		    <li>Absence of automatic phase correction</li>
	    </ul></em>

        <h5>Jamie Rhodes-Simpson — audio engineer & cinematographer</h5>
        <p><em>“Excellent customer service and excellent plugins — it’s really nice to be dealing with a real human being! …for a long while now I’ve been intrigued by the various recording techniques used for classical/orchestra and choirs…I had (a) stereo pair at the rear of the hall and a four mic array halfway down; two cardioid and two omnis on the outsides. I got to musing about the phase difference between the two cardioids and the two omnis on the same bar. So I did some maths and worked out the wavelength between the mics that was most likely to be an issue and then used RSPhaseShifter to mess with just that frequency and it was like lifting a veil. The sound before was fine, but it was just that bit better with the plugin enabled.”</em> See <em>What’s Your Headache</em> item #4 above…</p>
        <h5>Andy Rogulich — studio owner, engineer & Mix Magazine’s World Class Studio of 2017</h5>
        <p><em>“(I) purchased RSPhaseShifter right after I downloaded the trial version because I was so impressed with the results. I used it on a project…that had vocal added to electronic music and found the Delta feature to be such a quick way of determining what effects I was adding with RS PhaseShifter in the mirror mode. Really a great new useful tool for mastering to help enhance the dynamics of a recording. Looking forward to the next MAAT tool!”</em></p>
        <h5>Geo Hanlin a.k.a. “sonicdefault” — studio owner, engineer & musician</h5>
        <p><em>“Congratulations…MAAT team with this excellent plugin! I've been working with RSPS and think it sounds incredible. 
        </br>
        For years I’ve wanted a phase tool like this which allowed a continuous range, yet sound natural. I found most of the available products had various limitations, or didn’t retain adequate transparency. It was most important to me primarily with acoustic sourced material such as acoustic guitars. I think I can finally achieve what I've been wanting with RSPS…”</em></p>
        <h5>Dr. Heinrich Hohl — indy engineer</h5>
        <p><em>“RSPhaseShifter is…very helpful and I don't know of any other audio plugin that could perform the same tasks.”</em></p>
        <h5>Tim Teissen — musician & educator</h5>
        <p><em>“Of all the plugins I’m using in my DAW, I can imagine no other plugin that is able to fix phase issues like (RSPhaseShifter).”</em></p>

        <h5>Kieran Kenderessy — engineer & producer</h5>
        <p><em>“(RSPhaseShifter) isn’t always needed, but when it is, it’s a lifesaver…couldn’t mix without it now :)”</em></p>
        <h5>Meanwhile, on GearSlutz…</h5>
        <p>A couple of dudes <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/reviews/1189078-maat-digital-rsphaseshifter.html" target="_blank">reviewed</a> RSPhaseShifter.</p>
        <p>In another thread, wagz asked:<br>
        <em>“I was considering buying RSPhaseShifter. But, I already have MAutoAlign. Have you compared these two plugins, by any chance?”</em>
        <br><br>
        Karloff70 said:<br>
        <em>“Different thing. I also have MAutoAlign, but it hasn’t come in very useful after initial excitement. Comes up with a different guess each time you roll the dice. No dice involved in the RSPhaseShifter, just frequency specific, manually dialled in goodness.”</em>
        <br><br>
        Robo said:<br>
        <em>“Hi wagz, I haven’t used the MAutoAlign I’m afraid but I agree with everyone here, the RSPhaseShifter is one of those plugs that takes care of your audio, extremely transparent and you get out exactly what you put in (except for the phase changes of course!)”</em></p>
        <h5>BONEDO</h5>
        <p>A review by Dirk Wannemacher on BONEDO.de gave RSPhaseShifter four and a half stars out of five. We lost a half star for sticking to analog–style controls, just like the real thing! ;)</p>
        <p>From the review…</p>
        <p><em>“SOUND<br>The MAAT plug–in is sonically neutral. I could not perceive color or change other than the intended settings. The important transients also pass…without damage. The plug–in sound is on a level with the hardware modules from Roger Schult’s workshop. Nothing is colored. The module does exactly what the name says.”</em></p>
        <p><em>“CONCLUSION<br>The MAAT RSPhaseShifter can be used to correct phase errors. Through targeted use on individual tracks, the low end of a mix can be tidied up without pressure being lost, or the highs opened and broadened, (all) without sacrificing mono compatibility. Depending on the audio material and settings, the effect can be subtle to crass. The RSPhaseShifter can, in many cases, provide necessary icing on the cake, to make a good mix an excellent mix.”</em></p>

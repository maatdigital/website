          <h3>Your Sound, Your Way</h3>
          <p>Sharing the same user interface, MAAT’s two channel and multichannel LIN family are your final link between production and delivery. Offering optional word length reduction and seven noise shaping spectra tailored to both analog and digital delivery of assets, LIN is highly adjustable to help create your own signature “sound.” In addition to TPD and weighted TPD, LINpro and LINSurround feature four newly developed fifth, eighth and ninth order psychoacoustic noise shaping choices.
          </p>
          <p>Rounding performs fundamental linearization, what can be thought of as very low amplitude distortion reduction, by representing all former least significant bits with one single LSB in the resulting word length–reduced version. On the other hand, truncation does not preserve any of that low amplitude information. Instead, it’s just thrown away. LINEarise is one of the only redithering products available that offers a choice between rounding and truncation.

            <h3>Need More?</h3>
            <p>LINpro and LINSurround have it. As you’d expect, automatic muting and variable bit depth, 16 or 24 bits, but also a choice of 8 bit output to instantly hear how your current choice “sounds.” In addition to Triangular Probability Density Function (TPDF) and High Passed TPDF, rectangular dither is also available for educational or experimental exploration.
            </p>
            <p>LINpro and LINsurround incorporate the latest advances in auditory and psychoacoustic research. Other dithering engines rely on 20 year old technology. We at MAAT took our original LINearise engine, and realized that we could do it even better, with a mathematically superior approach and new thinking on the User Experience (UX). Whether you’re delivering a 16 bit Red Book dupe master, a 24 bit “high res” 88.2k file to today’s higher fidelity streaming services, or multichannel 48k stems for video and motion picture surround work, the LIN family will take you there with the best sounding product obtainable.

            <h3>Eyes On It</h3>
            <p>LINpro and LINsurround bring visual certainty to the arcane art of dithering. We’ve included real world plots of each noise shape for your viewing pleasure. These are not MATLAB simulations, they are actual plots generated by LINpro’s optimized dither engine. Notice that the -100dBFS input signal, that spike at the left side of the plot, is preserved even though the word length has been reduced to 16 bits. A 16–bit word can only encode or store 96dB of dynamic range. Any information quieter than -96dBFS should be lost when reducing the word length to 16 bits. With LIN, up to the 19<sup>th</sup> bit of the input signal is preserved — embedded in the 16<sup>th</sup> bit. 
            </p>
            <p>Dither is a fundamental aspect of today’s DAWs. Although not usually thought of as such, re-dithering is important DSP (Digital Signal Processing). In the distant past, much of the pioneering research on dither was performed at Bell Labs. According to information theory, you should add a pinch of noise to your digital audio every time you alter it to keep it distortion–free and to preserve program content by embedding it in the noise floor. That’s dither. Use it to make your digital audio less…“digital!”

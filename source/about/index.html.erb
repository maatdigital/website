<h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Once upon a time, a well respected mastering engineer had some sensible but unorthodox notions, and colleagues crazy enough to throw in with him…Thus was born the Pleasurize Music Foundation. Later in his career, that same guy decided to lift up the music community further by establishing the Mastering Academy. Those two enterprises formed the roots of MAAT; a dedication to quality, a desire to do good and a need to provide better sounding, easier to use tools and simpler workflows.</p>
      <p>We are real audio engineers, accomplished experts and digitally native problem solvers with well over 100 years of real world experience between the three of us. Our street cred is moderately huge already, and we have a broad range of gear available now and in the works, with unique approaches to metering, EQ and dynamics plus specialized utilities. We even have plans for some stuff you haven’t thought of yet! As a multi–national group of grizzled Yodas and kick ass Young Lions who share a need to further fidelity, our goal is to help your product sound better while making your studio a more pleasant workplace.</p>
      <p>We value our employees, the world we live on and industries we live in. We are not part of the race to the bottom you see all too often in pro audio. We develop and manufacture products without compromise; unobtrusive excellence is what we strive for. Forget the blingy, eye watering graphics and mediocre sound quality. As to our customers, we share their work ethic and a striving for fidelity. We are proud of their accomplishements, and work to provide them with the finest tools we can construct.</p>
      <p>The late Mark Peel, a chef’s chef, once said that, "You always want to play it close to the edge. If it’s too easy, you get sloppy." We also follow that philosophy. We don’t go for easy, we go for what’s best. Fidelity first and a pro level of customer service…that’s what we strive for.</p>
      <p>Give us a try, we think you’ll like our products. As Thelonious Monk once said, “The only cats worth anything are the cats that take chances.”

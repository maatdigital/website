        <h3>Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
          <h6>Peter Bellaert, producer, composer & arranger</h6>
          <p><em>“Your SantaCruzEQ and thEQorange kill ProQ and many other EQs!! You’ve got the best EQ I ever heard, really!!”</em></p>
          <h6>Thomas Joren Nielsen, Hollywood composer & engineer</h6>
          <p><em>“The high end on SantaCruzEQ is something of the gods. 10x better than oversampling on FabFilter Pro-Q3. And Neutron3 can kiss my ass. I really like having the algorithm (Architecture) options available too. Seriously, most plugins only have two “Digital Q or Analog Q” so this is something that really sets it apart. Will def be implementing this all over my mixes.”</em></p>
          <p>SantaCruzEQ leverages the power of thEQblue, with the same exceptional clarity and color. Here are some thoughts on thEQb for your consideration…</p>
          <h6>Arnold “DJ Kodi” Toutain</h6>
          <p><em>“…this plugin is simply the purest EQ plugin I had the opportunity to test. I bought it!</em></p>
          <h6>Stephan Mathieu, Schwebung Mastering</h6>
          <p><em>“thEQorange became my unrivaled critical EQ from day one on, period. Now that I’ve added thEQblue to my strictly selected palette of ITB processors, I can say that I’ve found my absolute dream team. So very well done, and I can’t wait for your version of the LP SplitComp to arrive, which most likely means that I’ll be able do all my ITB work with those three products. Maximal minimalism, my dream for 25 years coming true.<br>
          You know, the last 3 days I found the time to really deal with blue, and yesterday I started to become really excited with the MAAT EQ team. Not like having found a new toy, but having found a solution. I’m working all day with plugins since ’96 and something I’ve learned quickly is that I don’t want to use most of them but try to master only a handful instead. Here I go, and thanks again for that…Keep up the brilliant work.”</em></p>
          <h6>Sean Diggins, Digital Diggo Mastering</h6>
          <p><em>“thEQblue is a sleek, blue-sky clean “curve machine.” It's always about the curves and blue has the lot.”</em></p>
          <h6>Arpad Tchiba, engineer for award–winning classical pianist Martin Tchiba</h6>
          <p><em>“…Excellent, overwhelming! and looks beautiful. Thanks very much. It was absolutely worth waiting for.”</em></p>
          <h5>SantaCruzEQ actually improves on the original Classic PEQ Blue, since it uses the same algorithms as thEQblue, with increased precision for even finer low amplitude detail.</h5>
          <h6>Here’s legendary mastering engineer Bob Olhsson discussing his beloved original, Classic PEQ Blue</h6>
          <p><em>“I still use blue and red…Blue and red remain unsurpassed sound-wise.”</em></p>
          <h6>TKFP (Gearslutz), also on the original Classic PEQ Blue</h6>
          <p><em>“You know mixing without blue, is like cereals without milk. So many good and usable EQs out there. Lets face it. Im a sucker for that good EQ tho. I really rely on it. I dont wanna see my new system running without it. That Algo stuff is still untouched. Its really good. Really good.”</em></p>

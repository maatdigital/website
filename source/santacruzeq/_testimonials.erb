        <h3>Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
          <h5>Nikos "Rizon" Rizos — producer, mix engineer & loopmeister at RAW LOOPS</h5>
          <p><em>“First of all it sounds amazing! I don’t know what exactly is going on behind the scenes but it is superior in every aspect sound wise comparing to other EQ plugins.<br>
          It has a certain depth and keeps the signal’s integrity while sounding musical at the same time. Every time I tried to replace an emulation (Manley, Millenia, Neve, Sontec), by far I preferred SantaCruzEQ, sometimes with an extra transformer or preamp emulation after it if needed for some more colouration. But what makes it indispensable is that it retains the quality and characteristics of the material that passes through it. A well recorded, let’s say analog synth or drum machine, after passing through SantaCruzEQ is still a well recorded synth with some EQ on it, not a flat replica of the original.<br>
          I…was surprised by the depth and sonic accuracy it retains even with extreme settings. As the music we are involved in consists of deep subs and clean sine wave basses, many EQs fall short and loose depth and transient definition while managing those specific areas. That is not the case with SantaCruzEQ, it just does its job without messing with the signal. It is the first plugin we have heard that does that!”</em></p>

          <p><em>I just wanted to drop you a line now that I’ve had a chance to live with the SantaCruzEQ for a while and tell you it’s become one of my very favorite EQs. Although I usually flip through the Architectures and listen to the difference, I end up almost always using №1 Classic Sys, 2 Classic Asym, or №9 Const-Q Ideal.<br>
The thing I love about the sound is that it’s not clinical, but it is clear and defined, yet (sorry for this horrid cliché) warm. It is just a very sweet sounding EQ and the longer I have it, the more often I find myself throwing it on stuff. At this moment, I’m using it on the master bus of some video VO I recorded for my client Audio Modeling. All it needed was a little bit of low-mid dip after the master bus compressor, and I’m able to just get rid of the slight boominess without losing the body of the voice altogether.”</em></p>

          <h5>Peter “Minimalistix” Bellaert – producer, composer & arranger</h5>
          <p><em>“Your SantaCruzEQ and thEQorange kill ProQ and many other EQs!! You’ve got the best EQ I ever heard, really!!”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Thomas Joren Nielsen — composer & engineer</h5>
          <p><em>“The high end on SantaCruzEQ is something of the gods. 10x better than oversampling on FabFilter Pro-Q3. And Neutron3 can kiss my ass. I really like having the algorithm (Architecture) options available too. Seriously, most plugins only have two “Digital Q or Analog Q” so this is something that really sets it apart. Will def be implementing this all over my mixes.”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Ali Ramadan — Toronto CA & RAK City UAE</h5>
          <p><em>“Your products are boutique…SCEQ is the only EQ I am using beside <%= link_to "thEQblue", "https://www.maat.digital/theqblue/", target: "_blank" %> and <%= link_to "thEQorange", "https://www.maat.digital/theqorange/", target: "_blank" %> (for mastering). It’s light, easy to use, flexible, effective and ‘analog sounding.’ I am addicted to Classic Asym, Const Q Asym, and parallel FF-FB.”</em></p>

          <p><em>“MAAT SantaCruz EQ : Blown away !<br>
          I saw today a promo for SantaCruz EQ so gave it a chance & demoed it. For the moment it's the most incredible EQ that I had the opportunity to work with…<br>
          I mostly work in Pro Tools with PSP Neon (transparent), EQuilibrium (Swiss army knife) and stock Eq most of the time. I don't say that I will never ever use these plugins as I think they sound very well. But this thing…never heard such transparency or clarity in an EQ plugin for cleaning a mix or giving some air.<br>
          Tested SantaCruz against SSL X-EQ (supposed to be Algorithmix based) with Hofa A/B: I would say that Maat EQ sounds clean in a good way & never alter stereo image (solid sides). the SSL sounded great but changed the "panorama" of the songs.<br>
          &nbsp; + &nbsp;Pros: The sound!<br>
          &nbsp; - &nbsp;Cons : No meter, no analyzer & no mid/side processing<br></em></p>
          <p><em>…this plugin is simply the purest EQ I had the opportunity to test. I bought it!”</em></p>
          <h5>Don Gunn — engineer (Death Cab, Frampton, Soundgarden, King Crimson)</h5>
          <p><em>“I purchased <%= link_to 'RSPhaseShifter', 'https://www.maat.digital/rsphaseshifter/', target: '_blank' %> and SantaCruzEQ this week and I'm EXTREMELY pleased with my decision; these are truly excellent sounding tools that are already making me question some of my other plugin choices...”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Alex Solano — Alex Pro Mix</h5>
          <p>Alex uses SantaCruzEQ’s Architecture №5, Proportional 3, to <em>“…boost up the right amount of energy that’s already in a track…It has a particular sound that I like.”</em></p>

          <p>Alex also does a breakneck run through of SCEQ as part of a “Plugin Ranker” video and, despite erroneous info about Q control via mouse, concludes, <em>“…very impressive.”</em><p>

          <h5>Ignacio Ponce — Integraudio</h5>
          <p>Ignacio’s <%= link_to 'long form review', 'https://integraudio.com/14-best-eq-mixing-plugin/#SantaCruzEQ_By_MAAT_Labs', target: '_blank' %> includes audio example clips. SantaCruzEQ is given five out of five stars in all categories. His take: <em>“SCEQ was a very transparent and useful tool…Not only was it effective at balancing and tweaking the different bands, but it also gives you a lot of different options when it comes to EQing according to your needs. If you want a more musical way of cutting or boosting, you have a specific Architecture for that…It's a very good overall plug-in with many capabilities that are at the tip of your fingers.<br>
“The final verdict for SCEQ is positive. Being so versatile, complete, and feature-packed, there’s just no way you can go wrong with it. And besides the visual features, the developers at MAAT Labs have gone far and beyond to deliver the best possible sound experience with under-the-hood specs that give impressively low noise and distortion and high fidelity results.”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Trevon — Steady Sounds Music Group (via GearSlutz)</h5>
          <p><em>“I was at a studio today and i was mixing a track, but the song had alot of mud and resonance to it. No matter what I used I couldn't make it get clarity. I tried all my normal tools, but it either went harsh or lost some dimension. My buddy came in and said user maat eq and I tried it and with in minutes clarity and dimension…It is worth the hype they claim. Im buying tomorrow. Just other worlds better then the tools I was using before. Even Gullfoss couldn't help me.”</em></p>
          
          <h5>5 Cent (Gearslutz)</h5>
          <p><em>“I tested SCEQ and had to buy it. Fantastic workflow - on par with Pro-Q2/3, but in a different direction. The (playable) piano is a great idea and makes finding frequencies a breeze. Sound is good, too. I shot it out against Crave and in comparison that one sounded as if it was softening the signal whereas SCEQ did not. Still have use for Crave, but SCEQ has become my go-to mixing EQ :) Paired with preamp or console tone plugins this is making me use less AA EQs - except for Pultecery or other special cases…”</em></p>
          <p>SantaCruzEQ actually improves on the original Classic PEQ Blue, since it uses the same algorithms as thEQblue, with increased precision for even finer low amplitude detail. Here are some thoughts on thEQb’s exceptional clarity for your consideration…</p>
          
          <h5>Stephan Mathieu — Schwebung Mastering</h5>
          <p><em>“thEQorange became my unrivaled critical EQ from day one on, period. Now that I’ve added thEQblue to my strictly selected palette of ITB processors, I can say that I’ve found my absolute dream team. So very well done, and I can’t wait for your version of the LP SplitComp to arrive, which most likely means that I’ll be able do all my ITB work with those three products. Maximal minimalism, my dream for 25 years coming true.<br>
          You know, the last 3 days I found the time to really deal with blue, and yesterday I started to become really excited with the MAAT EQ team. Not like having found a new toy, but having found a solution. I’m working all day with plugins since ’96 and something I’ve learned quickly is that I don’t want to use most of them but try to master only a handful instead. Here I go, and thanks again for that…Keep up the brilliant work.”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Sean Diggins — Digital Diggo Mastering</h5>
          <p><em>“thEQblue is a sleek, blue-sky clean “curve machine.” It's always about the curves and blue has the lot.”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Arpad Tchiba — classical engineer</h5>
          <p><em>“…Excellent, overwhelming! and looks beautiful. Thanks very much. It was absolutely worth waiting for.”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Dr. Heinrich Hohl — indy engineer</h5>
          <p><em>“I have bought and tested many other EQs. Flux Epure, Sonnox EQ, DDMF, BlueCat Audio, Brainworx Hybrid, FabFilter ProQ2 and many more. None of these could really replace the Algorithmix EQs…Things have changed now with the MAAT releases. I want to thank you for giving us back these stellar EQs for work on modern operating systems. After more than 10 years of waiting, I finally have my top EQs back!”</em></p>
          
          <h5>Here’s legendary mastering engineer Bob Olhsson discussing his beloved original, Classic PEQ Blue</h5>
          <p><em>“I still use blue and red…Blue and red remain unsurpassed sound-wise.”</em></p>
          
          <h5>TKFP (Gearslutz), also on the original Classic PEQ Blue</h5>
          <p><em>“You know mixing without blue, is like cereals without milk. So many good and usable EQs out there. Lets face it. Im a sucker for that good EQ tho. I really rely on it. I dont wanna see my new system running without it. That Algo stuff is still untouched. Its really good. Really good.”</em></p>

        SITE PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

        this Agreement or infringement, misappropriation or violation of the
        intellectual property or other rights of any other person or entity,

      </p>

      <li>Arbitration. </li>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.1 Agreement to Arbitrate.</li>
        <p>
          This Section 11 is referred to herein as the “Arbitration Agreement.”
          The parties that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes
          between you and Company arising out of, relating to, or resulting from
          this Agreement, shall be subject to binding arbitration pursuant to
          the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement, and not any
          court action (other than a small claims court action to the extent the
          claim qualifies and other than claims for injunctive or other
          equitable relief). The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
          interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>

        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.2 Class Action Waiver. </li>
        <p>
          THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
          ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
          ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS
          BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR
          JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE
          PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS
          PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY,
          INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL
          PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
          RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
        </p>

        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.3 Procedures. </li>
        <p>
          11.3 Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
          accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules
          and procedures (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration
          Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and
          this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement
          will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of
          the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a
          fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the
          provisions of this Agreement as a court would, including without
          limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 10. You
          may visit http://www.adr.org for information on the AAA and
          http://www.adr.org/fileacase for information on how to file a claim
          against the Company.
        </p>

        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.4 Venue.</li>
        <p>
          The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at
          another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is
          $10,000 or less, you or Company may elect to have the arbitration
          conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which
          election shall be binding on each party, but subject to the
          arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing if the
          circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made
          by telephone by either or both parties unless the arbitrator requires
          otherwise.
        </p>

        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.5 Governing Law. </li>
        <p>
          The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance
          with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its
          conflicts of laws rules, and will honor all claims of privilege
          recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in
          prior arbitrations involving different Site users, but is bound by
          rulings in prior arbitrations involving you to the extent required by
          applicable law.
        </p>

        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.6 Costs of Arbitration.</li>
        <p>
          Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
          (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed
          by the AAA's Rules. Each party will be responsible for all other fees
          it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without
          limitation, all attorney fees.
        </p>

        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.7 Confidentiality. </li>
        <p>
          All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or
          award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit
          of all parties.
        </p>

        <li style="list-style-type:none;">11.8 Severability.</li>
        <p>
          If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration
          Agreement other than Section 11.2 is invalid or unenforceable, the
          parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
          provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
          expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
          provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so
          modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of Section
          11.2 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
          Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of this
          Agreement will continue to apply.</p>
      </ul>

      <li>Miscellaneous.</li>
      <p>
        The Company may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this
        Agreement (“Changes”) at any time. Changes will be effective: (i) thirty
        (30) days after the Company provides notice of the Changes, whether such
        notice is provided through the Site user interface, is sent to the
        e-mail address associated with your account or otherwise; or (ii) when
        you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of
        this Agreement incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first. Under
        this Agreement, you consent to receive communications from the Company
        electronically. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
        accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving
        effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action
        at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
        Site that is not subject to arbitration under Section 11 shall be filed
        only in the state or federal courts in the State of California (or a
        small claims court of competent jurisdiction) and you hereby consent and
        submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of
        litigating any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party
        may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or other
        equitable relief. The failure of any party at any time to require
        performance of any provision of this Agreement shall in no manner affect
        such party’s right at a later time to enforce the same. A waiver of any
        breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
        continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other provisions of
        this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful,
        void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be
        deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity
        and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This Agreement, and any
        rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or
        assigned by you, but may be assigned by the Company without restriction.
        This is the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter
        herein and shall not be modified except in a writing, signed by both
        parties, or by a change to this Agreement made by the Company as set
        forth herein.
